<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>In this lab we we take quick tour of some of Oracle Solaris security features
that can help you to protect your applications and your system. We will look at
the following technologies:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Privileges</li> 
<li>RBAC (Rights and Authorizations)</li> 
<li>Integration with SMF (Service Management Facility)</li>

</ul>

<p>For lab exercises S.3 and S.4, apache 2.2 is required. Check if it's installed already:</p>

<pre>
root@solaris:~# <kbd>pkg list *apache*</kbd> 
NAME (PUBLISHER)                                  VERSION                    IFO

 <h2><a id="S.1"></a>Exercise S.1: Introduction to Solaris RBAC and
 Privileges</h2>

<p>Expected duration: 20 minutes</p>

<p>The goal of this exercise is to gain a basic understanding of the
RBAC/privileges framework in Solaris.</p>

<h3>Background Information</h3>

<p>Thanks to <a href="http://www.c0t0d0s0.org/authors/1-Joerg-Moellenkamp">Joerg Moellenkamp</a> and 
his post on <a href="http://www.c0t0d0s0.org/archives/4073-Less-known-Solaris-features-RBAC-and-Privileges-Part-1-Introduction.html">
Less known Solaris features: RBAC and Privileges - Part 1: Introduction</a> for the following introduction.</p>

<h4>The Story of <code>root</code></h4>

<p>And then there was <code>root</code>. And <code>root</code> was almighty. And that
wasn't a good thing. <code>root</code> was able to control the world without any
control. And <code>root</code> needed control. It was only a short chant between the
mere mortals and <code>root</code>. Everybody with the knowledge of the magic chant
was able to speak through <code>root</code>.</p>

<p>But <code>root</code> wasn't alone. <code>root</code> had servants called daemons.
Some of one them needed divine powers to do their daily job. But <code>root</code>
was an undividable being. So the servants had to work with the powers of
<code>root</code>. But the servants were not as perfect as root: Some of the
servants started to do everything mere mortals said to them if they only said
more than a certain amount of prayers at once.</p>

<h4>Superuser</h4>

<p>The old model of rights in a Unix systems is based on a duality. There is the
superuser and the normal user. The normal users have a restricted set of rights
in the system, the superuser has an unrestricted set of rights. To modify the
system, a normal user has to login as <code>root</code> directly or assume the
rights of root (by <code>su -</code>). But such a user has unrestricted access to
the system. Often this isn't desirable. Why should you enable an operator to
modify a system, when all he or she has do to on the system is create some users
from time to time. You've trained them to do <code>useradd</code> or
<code>passwd</code>. What do you do when they get too curious? They need
<code>root</code> privileges to create a user or change a password. You need some
mechanisms to limit this operator.</p>

<p>But it gets more problematic. Programs have to modify the system to work. A
web server is a good example. You expect it to use port 80, ports beneath port
number 1024 are privileged ports. You need special rights to modify the
structures of the system to listen to port 80. A normal user doesn't have these
rights. So the web server has to be started as root. The children of this
process drop the rights of root by running with a normal user. But there is this
single instance of the program with all the rights of the superuser. This process has
much more rights than needed, a possible attack vector for malicious users.</p>

<h4>Least Privilege</h4>

<p>There is a concept in security known as <em>least privilege</em>. You give
someone only least amount of privileges, only enough to do the tasks they are
assigned. An example of the real world - you won't give the janitor the master
key for all the rooms on the campus, when all he has to do is work in Building
C. The other way around - there are some trusted people who have access to all
rooms in case of emergency.</p>

<p>You have the same concept in computer security. Everyone should have only the
least amount of privileges in the system to do their job. The concept of the
superuser doesn't match to this, it's an all or nothing model. You are either an
ordinary user with basic privileges or you are a user with unrestricted rights.
There is nothing in between. This doesn't follow the least privileges model.</p>

<h4>Role Based Access Control (RBAC)</h4>

<p>The example with the key for the janitors is a good example. Let's imagine a
large campus. You have janitors responsible for the plumbing (let's call them
Lenny and Carl), for the park (let's call him Homer), for the security system
(let's call her Marge and Lenny helps her from time to time).</p>

<p>These roles have different sets of privileges: For example the plumbing
janitors have access to all the rooms of the heating system. The janitor for the
park has only access to the garage with the lawnmower.</p>

<p>When they start to work in their job, they assume a role. From the privilege
perspective it's not important who is the person, but what role the person has
assumed. Lenny punches the clock and assumes the role of the plumbing janitor
for the next 8 hours. And while he is doing its job he uses the privileges
inherent to the role. But he also has to do tasks in his office or in his
workshop. It's his own room, so he doesn't need the special privileges.</p>

<p>Role Based Access Control is quite similar. You login to the system, and then
you start to work. You read your emails (no special privileges needed), you find
an email "Create user xy45345. Your Boss". Okay, now you need special
privileges. You assume the role of a User Administrator and create the user. Job
done, you don´t need the privileges anymore. You leave the role and write the
"Job done" mail to your boss with your normal user's privileges.</p>

<p>Role Based Access Control is all about this: Defining roles, giving them
privileges and assigning users to this roles.</p>

<h4>Privileges</h4>

<p>I've used the word quite often in this introduction so far. What is a
privilege? A privilege is the right to do something. For example, having the
keys for the control panel of the heating system.</p>

<p>Unix users are nothing different. Every user has privileges in a Unix system.
A normal user has the privilege to open, close, read, write and delete files
when he is allowed to do this (Because he created it, because he belongs to the
same group as the creator of the file or the creator gave everybody the right to
do it). This looks normal to you, but it's privilege based on the login
credentials you gave to system. You don't have the privilege to read all files
on the system or to use a port number 1024.</p>

<p>Every thing done in the system is based on these privileges. Solaris has
separated the tasks into many privilege sets. At the moment, there are more than 80
different privileges in the system. Normal users have only a basic set of privileges,
 while <code>root</code> has all of them.</p>

<p>In Solaris the model has changed, privileges and users aren't connected with
each other. You can give any user the power of the traditional "root user", and
restrict the privileges of the root user. Solaris is configured to look as a
traditional super user model due to its binary compatibility guarantee that
mandates that the standard configuration of the system resembles the superuser
model. There are applications out there, which assume that only the <code>root</code>
user or the UID 0 has unrestricted rights and exit if they are started by a
different user.</p>

<p>The only thing that is special with UID 0 in Solaris is that it's the owner
of the system configuration files, and thus has the capability to change system
configurations.</p>

<h3>RBAC and Privileges in Solaris</h3>

<p>Both features have their roots in the Trusted Solaris product. Trusted Solaris
was a version of Solaris to ensure the highest security standards. Today, these
mechanisms are part of the normal Solaris in conjunction with the Trusted
Extensions. So RBAC is a really old feature - it has been in Solaris since
Solaris 8 (published in 2000). Privileges found their way into the generic
Solaris with the first availability of Solaris 10 in February 2005.</p>

<p>Lets start with some basic concepts for RBAC:</p>

<ul> 

<li><strong>Rights</strong>: A right is the permission, to execute an executable as
an privileged user. For example the permission to execute the command
<code>reboot</code> as <code>root</code>.</li>

<li><strong>Authorization</strong>: A permission	that enables a user or role to
perform a class of actions that could affect security. For example, security
policy at installation gives ordinary users the <code>solaris.device.cdrw
authorization</code>. This authorization enables users to read and write to a
CD-ROM device.</li> 

<li><strong>Right Profiles</strong>: A collection of administrative
capabilities that can be assigned to a role or to a user. A rights profile can
consist of authorizations, of commands with security attributes, and of other
rights profiles. Rights profiles offer a convenient way to group security
attributes.</li> 

<li><strong>Role:</strong> A special identity for running privileged
applications. The special identity can be assumed by assigned users only. In a
system that is run by roles, superuser is unnecessary. Superuser capabilities
are distributed to different roles.</li> 
</ul>

<p>Lets take a closer look at RBAC and roles:</p>

<p>Open a terminal window by right clicking any point in the background of the
desktop, and select "Open Terminal" in the pop-up menu.</p>


<p>Lets look at what roles are assigned to our <code>lab</code> user. In a
terminal, run the following command:</p> 

<pre>lab@solaris:~$ <kbd>roles</kbd>
root
</pre> 

<p>As you can see here you should be assigned the role <code>root</code>, it allows
us to assume the <code>root</code> role. In Solaris 11 root is not a user but rather
a role. So you have to login to the system as a normal user and then assume the
<code>root</code> role with the <code>su</code> command.</p>

<p>In a terminal window type as follows:</p> 

<pre>lab@solaris:~$ <kbd>userattr type root</kbd> 
role
lab@solaris:~$ <kbd>auths root</kbd> 
solaris.*
</pre> 

<p>As you can see here <code>root</code> is defined as a role with
all solaris authorizations, the effect of this is similar to
the old almighty <code>root</code> user. This is put in place for backwards
compatibility.</p>

<p>And as your user is assigned the <code>root</code> role, you can try this by
assuming the <code>root</code> role:</p>

<pre>lab@solaris:~$ <kbd>whoami</kbd>
lab
lab@solaris:~$ <kbd>su </kbd>
Password: &lt;root password&gt; 
lab@solaris:~# <kbd>whoami</kbd>
root 
lab@solaris:~# <kbd>who am i</kbd>
lab   pts/1        Apr 21 07:32	(:0.0)
lab@solaris:~# <kbd>exit </kbd>
exit 
lab@solaris:~$ </pre> 

<p>Lets add a new user, Joe Doe to our system:</p> 

<pre>lab@solaris:~$ <kbd>useradd -d /export/home/jdoe -m -c "Joe Doe" jdoe </kbd>
UX: useradd: ERROR: Cannot update system - login cannot be created.
</pre> 

<p>As you can see here we are not allowed to use the <code>useradd</code> command.
We will have to use <code>su</code> to execute <code>useradd</code> with "root"
privileges, and assign missing rights to our account. The <code>su</code> command
will prompt you for the root password.</p>

 <pre>lab@solaris:~$ <kbd>su root -c "usermod -K profiles='User Management' lab" </kbd>
Password: &lt;your root password&gt;

lab@solaris:~$ <kbd>userattr profiles lab</kbd>
User Management

</pre>

<p>As you can see, we now have the right to manage users. To take advantage of
this right, we will invoke a profile shell, e.g. <code>pfbash</code>, and create the
new user, jdoe.</p>



<pre>
lab@solaris:~$ <kbd>pfbash </kbd>
lab@solaris:~$ <kbd>useradd  -m -c "Joe Doe" jdoe</kbd> 
</pre>  

<p>To change the
user's password we have to have User Security profile assigned, but it is not
advised to assign it to a regular user because it allows the user to change
passwords of other users, including more powerful ones. User Management profile
is safe, because you can only delegate what you already have. Therefore, let's
change the password of the new user using root role:</p>


<pre>lab@solaris:~$ <kbd>su root -c passwd jdoe</kbd> 
Password: &lt;root password&gt; 
New Password: <kbd>abc123</kbd> 
Re-enter new Password: <kbd>abc123</kbd> 
passwd: password successfully changed for jdoe
lab@solaris:~$ <kbd>su - jdoe </kbd>
Password: <kbd>abc123</kbd> 
Oracle Corporation    SunOS 5.11 11.0    November 2011 
jdoe@solaris:~$ <kbd>roles </kbd>
No roles
jdoe@solaris:~$ <kbd>su root</kbd> 
Password: &lt;root password&gt; 
Roles can only be assumed by authorized users 
su: Sorry
jdoe@solaris:~$ <kbd>exit</kbd> 
lab@solaris:~$ 
</pre> 


<h4>NEW in Role Authentication in Solaris 11</h4>

<p>Role Authentication procedure has changed in Solaris 11. Running earlier
Solaris version, including Oracle Solaris 11 Express, user had to know role
password in order to assume the role. Oracle Solaris 11 includes the ability to
specify whether to use the role password or user password when a user wants to
assume a given role. Administrators can specify either 'user' or
'role' for the 'roleauth' keyword. If roleauth is not specified, 'role' is
implied. Any newly created roles will be 'user' by default.</p>

<h4>Summary</h4>

<p>As you can see here <code>jdoe</code> doesn't have any roles assigned to him and
he can't use <code>su</code> to assume the <code>root</code> role. We'll get back to him
later. Now let's move on to a closer look at privileges in Exercise 2.</p>


<h2><a id="S.2">Exercise S.2: A Closer Look at Solaris Privileges</a></h2>

<p>Expected duration: 20 minutes </p>

<p>The goal of this exercise is to understand Solaris privileges and how to use
them.</p>

<h3>Background Information</h3>

<h4>Privileges</h4>

<p>What are Privileges? Privileges are rights to do an operation in the kernel.
These rights are enforced by the kernel. Whenever you do something within the
kernel the access is controlled by privileges.</p>

<h4>List of privileges</h4>

<p>contract_event, contract_identity, contract_observer, cpc_cpu, dtrace_kernel,
dtrace_proc, dtrace_user, file_chown, file_chown_self, file_dac_execute,
file_dac_read, file_dac_search, file_dac_write, file_downgrade_sl,
file_flag_set, <font color="#0000ff">file_link_any</font>, file_owner,
file_setid, file_upgrade_sl, graphics_access, graphics_map, ipc_dac_read,

win_config, win_dac_read, win_dac_write, win_devices, win_dga, win_downgrade_sl,
win_fontpath, win_mac_read, win_mac_write, win_selection, win_upgrade_sl,
xvm_control</p>

<p>Legend: <font color="#0000ff">blue - basic privilege</font></p>

<h4>Conventional Unix</h4>

<p>On conventional Unix systems you have a <code>root</code> user and <code>root</code> has all
privileges. And you have a normal user, who has only a limited set of
privileges. Sometimes you need the rights of an admin to do some tasks. You
don't even need to administer the system.</p>

<pre>
lab@solaris:~$ <kbd>ls -l /usr/sbin/traceroute</kbd> 
-r-sr-xr-x 1 root bin 46868 2010-11-05 08:02 /usr/sbin/traceroute 
lab@solaris:~$ <kbd>ls -l /usr/sbin/ping</kbd> 
-r-sr-xr-x 1 root bin 55940 2010-11-05 08:01 /usr/sbin/ping 
</pre>



<p>You can use <code>traceroute</code> and <code>ping</code> because
both tools are <code>setuid</code> tools. <code>setuid</code> allows a process to run
with a specific userid and <b>all</b> the privileges that come with that
user. In the case of <code>setuid</code> to root user the process would have root's
privileges. A <code>setuid</code> program in Solaris can be privilege-aware and
hence only retain the privileges needed for the operation.</p>

<p>You need a special privilege to <code>ping</code> - the privilege to
use access ICMP. On conventional systems this right is reserved for the
<code>root</code> user. Thus the <code>ping</code> program has to be executed with the
rights of <code>root</code>. The problem: At the time of the execution of the
program, the program has all the rights of the user. Not only to access ICMP,
but the program is capable of doing everything on the system, such as deleting
files in <code>/etc</code>. This may not a problem with <code>ping</code> or
<code>traceroute</code> but think about larger programs. An exploit in a
<code>setuid</code> program can lead to the escalation of the user's privileges.


<p>Let's have a look at the privileges of an ordinary user. There is a tool to
get the privileges of any given process in the system, it's called
<code>ppriv</code>. The variable <code>$$</code> is a shortcut for the actual process id (in this
case the process id of the user's shell):</p> 

<pre>lab@solaris:~$ <kbd>ppriv $$ </kbd>
1684:    -bash 
flags = &lt;none&gt;
    E: basic 
    I: basic 
    P: basic 
    L: all 
</pre> 

<p>To find out what "basic" means, we can add <code>&#45;v</code> to the <code>ppriv</code> flag
to expand the aliases:</p>  

<pre>lab@solaris:~$ ppriv -v $$ 
1684:    -bash flags = &lt;none&gt;
	E: file_link_any,file_read,file_write,net_access,proc_exec,proc_fork,proc_info,proc_session
	I: file_link_any,file_read,file_write,net_access,proc_exec,proc_fork,proc_info,proc_session
	P: file_link_any,file_read,file_write,net_access,proc_exec,proc_fork,proc_info,proc_session
	L: contract_event,contract_identity,contract_observer,cpc_cpu,dtrace_kernel,dtrace_proc,....


 </pre>

<p>Every process in the system has four sets of privileges that determine if a
process is enabled to use a privilege or not. The theory of privileges is quite
complex. I would suggest to read the chapter <a
href="http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19253-01/816-4863/priv-7/index.html">
How Privileges Are Implemented"</a> in the 
<a href="http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19253-01/816-4863/index.html">
Developers Guide to Oracle Solaris Security</a> 
to learn how each set controls or is controlled other
privilege sets.</p>

<p>At this time, I want only to explain the meaning of the first letter: </p>

<ul><li><b>E</b>: <b>E</b>ffective privileges set</li>
	<li><b>I</b>: <b>I</b>nheritable privileges set</li> 
    <li><b>P</b>: <b>P</b>ermitted privileges set</li> 
    <li><b>L</b>: <b>L</b>imit privileges set</li> 
</ul>





<p>You can think about the privilege sets as keyrings. The
<em>effective</em> privilege set are the keys the janitor has on its
keyring. The <em>permitted</em> privilege set are the keys the janitor is
allowed to put on its keyring. The janitor can decide to remove some of the
keys. Perhaps he thinks: I work only in room 232 today, I don't need all the
other keys. I'll leave them in my office. When he looses his keyring he lost
only the control of this single room, not about the complete campus. </p>

<p>The <em>inheritable</em> privilege set is not really a keyring. The
janitor thinks about his new assistant: "Good worker, but I will not give him my
key for the room with the expensive tools." The <em>limited
privilege</em> set is the overarching order from the boss of janitor to his
team leaders: "You are allowed to give your assistant the keys for normal rooms,
but not for the rooms with all this blinking boxes from Oracle".
</p>

<p>At the moment the most interesting set is the E:. This is the effective set
of privileges. This is the set of privilege effectively available to process.
Compared to the full list of privileges mentioned above the set is much smaller.
But this matches your experience when you use a Unix system. </p>

<p>Lets see how it looks when we assume the root role:</p>  
<pre>
lab@solaris:~$ <kbd>su -</kbd> 
Password: &lt;root password&gt; 
Oracle Corporation    SunOS 5.11    11.0    November 2011
You have new mail. 
root@solaris:~# <kbd>ppriv $$</kbd> 
1779:    -bash 
flags = &lt;none&gt;
    E: all 
    I: basic 
    P: all 
    L: all 
</pre>



<p>This role has much more privileges. The effective set is much broader. When
we assume the root role we assume all privileges in the system. NOTE: This is
strictly to provide backwards compatibility and is not the recommended usage
going forward.</p>

<p>Lets add some privileges to our <code>jdoe</code> user, let's assume that he is a
software developer that needs access to DTrace to debug some applications.</p>

<p>First lets try to use DTrace as jdoe:</p> 
<pre># <kbd>su - jdoe </kbd>
Password: abc123 
Oracle Corporation    SunOS 5.11    11.0    November 2011 
jdoe@solaris:~$ ppriv $$ 
1790:    -bash 
flags = &lt;none&gt;
    E: basic 
    I: basic 
    P: basic 
    L: all 
jdoe@solaris:~$ dtrace -l
dtrace: failed to initialize dtrace: DTrace requires additional privileges
</pre> 

<p>As we can see here <code>jdoe</code> is missing some privileges to be allowed to
use DTrace. There are have 3 privileges needed for DTrace: <code>dtrace_kernel,
dtrace_proc, dtrace_user</code>, depending on what the user needs to use
DTrace for. We can add these privileges to the user in three different ways: </p>

<ol> <li>Add the privileges needed to the user. This would allow the user to use
	DTrace as him or herself.</li>

	<li>Create an execution profile with the <code>dtrace</code> command and the
	needed 	privileges, and assign the profile to the user. This would allow him
	or her to use a profile shell (i.e., <code>pfbash</code>) to execute the
	<code>dtrace</code> command.</li> 

    <li>Create a role with the needed privileges, and
	assign the role to user. This 	would require the user to assume the role to
	use DTrace.</li> 
</ol>



<p>Lets see how to add dtrace privileges directly to the user:</p> 
<pre>
root@solaris:~# usermod -K defaultpriv=basic,dtrace_kernel,dtrace_proc,dtrace_user jdoe 
 </pre>



<p>Let's see if <code>jdoe</code> now has all needed privileges to use the
<code>dtrace</code> command:</p> 

<pre>lab@solaris:~$ <kbd>su - jdoe </kbd>
Password: <kbd>abc123 </kbd>
Oracle Corporation    SunOS 5.11    11.0    November 2011 
jdoe@solaris:~$ <kbd>ppriv $$ </kbd>
1814: -bash 
flags = &lt;none&gt; 
    E: basic,dtrace_kernel,dtrace_proc,dtrace_user 
    I: basic,dtrace_kernel,dtrace_proc,dtrace_user 
    P: basic,dtrace_kernel,dtrace_proc,dtrace_user 
    L: all
jdoe@solaris:~$ <kbd>dtrace -l | more</kbd>
   ID   PROVIDER            MODULE                          FUNCTION NAME
    1     dtrace                                                     BEGIN
    2     dtrace                                                     END
    3     dtrace                                                     ERROR
    7    syscall                                               nosys entry
    8    syscall                                               nosys return
    9    syscall                                               rexit entry
   10    syscall                                               rexit return

</pre> 

<p>OK, so that worked, just for the fun of it lets try to create a role that
does the same.</p>

<p>First lets remove the dtrace privileges from jdoe:</p>  
<pre>
root@solaris:~# <kbd>usermod -K defaultpriv=basic jdoe</kbd>
root@solaris:~# <kbd>userattr defaultpriv jdoe </kbd>
basic 
</pre> 

<p>Then lets create a new role (using root shell, i.e. as a <em>root</em> user),
lets call the role "bugger", and assign it to <code>jdoe</code></p>

root@solaris:~# <kbd>roleadd -u 201 -d /export/home/bugger -P "Process Management" bugger</kbd>

root@solaris:~# <kbd>passwd bugger </kbd>
New Password: <kbd>abc123 </kbd>
Re-enter new Password: <kbd>abc123</kbd> 
passwd: password successfully changed for bugger

root@solaris:~# <kbd>rolemod -K defaultpriv=basic,dtrace_kernel,dtrace_proc,dtrace_user bugger </kbd>
root@solaris:~# <kbd>userattr defaultpriv bugger</kbd> 
basic,dtrace_kernel,dtrace_proc,dtrace_user
root@solaris:~# <kbd>usermod -R bugger jdoe </kbd>
root@solaris:~# <kbd>roles jdoe</kbd> 
bugger
</pre>  


<p>OK, lets try and see if <code>jdoe</code> now can use DTrace</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>Now you should have a basic understanding about privileges and how you can
assign them to users, however wouldn't it be nice if we could do the same to
processes? We will look at that in Exercise S.3.</p> 

<h2><a id="S.3">Exercise S.3: Process Privileges and Rights</a></h2>

<p>Expected duration: 10 minutes</p>

<h3>Background</h3>

<p>We have looked at how you can add privileges to a user, now we'll look at how
privileges interact with processes, we will look at both processes that are
<em>privilege aware</em> and processes that are <em>non-privilege
aware</em>.</p>

<p>The idea of managing privileges is not limited to users and their shells.
In any given system you find dozens of programs running as daemons.</p>

<p>These daemons interact in several ways with the privileges. The best way is
"<em>privilege-aware programming</em>". Let's assume you code a daemon for your
system. For example: You know that your daemon will never do an <code>exec()</code>
call. So you can safely drop this privilege. The process modifies the permitted
privilege set. The process can remove a privilege but not add it. Even when
someone is able to access your process, the attacker can't make an
<code>exec()</code> call. The process doesn't even have the privilege to do such a
call. And the attacker can't add the privilege again. Several processes and
programs in Solaris are already privilege aware. For example the kernel-level
cryptographic framework daemon. Let's look at the privileges of the daemon.</p>

<p>In order to observe or manage privileges, a process must itself already have
those privileges. Therefore we will assume the root role for the following
exercise.</p>

<pre>lab@solaris:~$ <kbd>su - root</kbd>
Password: &lt;root password&gt; 
root@solaris:~# ps -ef | grep kcfd 
  daemon    80     1   0 06:04:21 ?           0:00 /lib/crypto/kcfd

root@solaris:~# <kbd>ppriv -v 80</kbd>
80:	/lib/crypto/kcfd
flags = PRIV_AWARE
	E: file_owner,file_read,file_write,net_access,proc_priocntl,sys_devices
	I: none
	P: file_owner,file_read,file_write,net_access,proc_priocntl,sys_devices
	L: none

</pre>

<p>This daemon doesn't have even the basic privileges of a regular user. It has
the only the bare minimum of privileges to do its job.</p>

<h3>Non-privilege aware processes</h3>

<p>But the world isn't perfect. Not every process is privilege aware. Thus you
have to limit the privileges by other mechanisms. The Service Management
Facility comes to help. The following example is copied from Glenn Brunette's
Blueprint <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/server-storage/archive/a11-009-limiting-privileges-sol10-438977.pdf">
Limiting Service Privileges in the Solaris 10 Operating
System</a>.</p>

<p>Let's take the Apache Webserver as an example. The apache web server is not
privilege aware. We start the daemon via the Service Management Framework
(SMF).</p>

<pre>root@solaris:~# <kbd>svcadm -v enable -s apache22 </kbd>
svc:/network/http:apache22 enabled. </pre> 

<p>OK, now we look at the processes of the Apache daemons.</p>

<pre>root@solaris:~# <kbd>ps -ef | grep "apache" | grep -v grep</kbd>
webservd  1894  1891   0 12:35:00 ?           0:00 /usr/apache2/2.2/bin/httpd -k start
webservd  1892  1891   0 12:35:00 ?           0:00 /usr/apache2/2.2/bin/httpd -k start
webservd  1893  1891   0 12:35:00 ?           0:00 /usr/apache2/2.2/bin/httpd -k start
    root  1891     1   0 12:34:59 ?           0:00 /usr/apache2/2.2/bin/httpd -k start
webservd  1895  1891   0 12:35:00 ?           0:00 /usr/apache2/2.2/bin/httpd -k start
webservd  1896  1891   0 12:35:00 ?           0:00 /usr/apache2/2.2/bin/httpd -k start

</pre> 

<p>Five daemons are running as webservd, and one is running as root.</p>

<pre>
root@solaris:~# <kbd>ppriv 1891</kbd>
1891:	/usr/apache2/2.2/bin/httpd -k start
flags = <none>
	E: all
	I: basic
	P: all
	L: all
</pre> 

<p>As expected for a root process, this process has the complete set of
privileges of a root user. Now lets look at one of its children:</p>

<pre>
root@solaris:~# <kbd>ppriv 1895</kbd>
1895:	/usr/apache2/2.2/bin/httpd -k start
flags = <none>
	E: basic
	I: basic
	P: basic
	L: all
</pre> 

<p>Much better... Only basic privileges.</p>

<p>OK, There is a reason for this configuration. On Unix systems, you have two
groups of ports. Privileged ones from 1-1023 and unprivileged ones from 1024 up.
You can only bind to a privileged port with the privilege to do it. A normal
user doesn't have this privilege, but <code>root</code> does. And thus there has to be one
process running as root. Do you remember the list of privileges for the apache
process running at root? The process has all privileges but needs only one of
them, that isn't part of the basic privilege set.</p>


<h2><a id="S.4">Exercise S.4: SMF, Process Privileges and Authorizations</a></h2>

<p>Expected duration: 10 minutes</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>We have now looked at both privilege aware and non-privilege aware processes,
now lets look at how we can use SMF to let a user with a limited set of
privileges manage a non-privilege aware process and give it the required
privileges without using setuid to root.</p>

<p>In order to observe or manage privileges, a process must itself already have
those privileges. Therefore we will assume the root role for the following
exercise.</p>



<h3>Background</h3>

<h4>How to get rid of the <code>root</code> apache process</h4>

<p>It doesn't have to be this way. With Solaris you can give any user or process the
privilege to use a privileged port. You don't need the root process anymore.</p>

<p>Let's configure it this way. At first we have to deactivate the running
apache from Exercise S.3:</p>

<pre>
lab@solaris:~$ <kbd>su - root</kbd>
Password: &lt;root password&gt; 
root@solaris:~# <kbd>svcadm -v disable -s apache22</kbd>
svc:/network/http:apache22 disabled. </pre> 

<p>We will not be explaining the Service Management Facility here, but you can
set certain properties in SMF to control the startup of a service:</p>

<pre>
1  root@solaris:~# <kbd>svccfg -s apache22</kbd> 
2  svc:/network/http:apache22&gt; <kbd>setprop start/user = astring: webservd</kbd> 
3  svc:/network/http:apache22&gt; <kbd>setprop start/group = astring: webservd</kbd> 
4  svc:/network/http:apache22&gt; <kbd>setprop start/privileges = astring: basic,!proc_session,!proc_info,!file_link_any,net_privaddr</kbd> 
5  svc:/network/http:apache22&gt; <kbd>setprop start/limit_privileges = astring: :default</kbd> 
6  svc:/network/http:apache22&gt; <kbd>setprop start/use_profile = boolean: false </kbd>
7  svc:/network/http:apache22&gt; <kbd>setprop start/supp_groups = astring: :default</kbd> 
8  svc:/network/http:apache22&gt; <kbd>setprop start/working_directory = astring: :default </kbd>
9  svc:/network/http:apache22&gt; <kbd>setprop start/project = astring: :default </kbd>
10 svc:/network/http:apache22&gt; <kbd>setprop start/resource_pool = astring: :default </kbd>
11 svc:/network/http:apache22&gt; <kbd>end</kbd>

</pre> 

<p>Line 2 to 4 are the most interesting ones. Without any changes, the Apache
daemon starts as root and forks away processes with the webservd user. But we
want to get rid of the root user for this configuration. Thus we start the
daemon directly with the webservd user, the same goes for the group id.</p>

<p>Now it gets interesting. Without this line (line 4), the kernel would deny
Apache to bind to port 80. webservd is a regular user without the privilege to
use a privileged port. The property <code>start/privileges</code> sets the
privileges to start the service. At first, we give the service basic privileges.
Then we add the privilege to use a privileged port. The service would start up
now.</p>

<p>But wait, we can do more. A webserver shouldn't do any hardlinks. And it
doesn't send signals outside it's session. And it doesn't look at processes
other than those to which it can send signals. We don't need these privileges.
<b>proc_session</b>, <b>proc_info</b> and <b>file_link_any</b> are part of the
basic privilege set. We remove them, by adding a &#33; in front of the
privilege:</p>

<pre>root@solaris:~# <kbd>svcadm -v refresh apache22</kbd>  
Action refresh set for svc:/network/http:apache22.
</pre>

<p>OK, we have notified SMF of the configuration changes.</p>

<p>Until now, the apache daemon used the <code>root</code> privileges. Thus the
ownership of files and directories were unproblematic. The daemon was able to
read and write in any directory or file in the system. As we drop its privilege
set by using a regular user, we have to modify the ownership of some files and
move some files:</p>

<pre>
root@solaris:~# <kbd>mkdir -p -m 755 /var/apache2/2.2/run</kbd> 
root@solaris:~# <kbd>chown webservd:webservd /var/apache2/2.2/run</kbd> 
root@solaris:~# <kbd>chown webservd:webservd /var/apache2/2.2/logs/access_log</kbd> 
root@solaris:~# <kbd>chown webservd:webservd /var/apache2/2.2/logs/error_log</kbd>

</pre>

<p>We need some configuration changes, too. We have to move the LockFile and the
PidFile. There wasn't one of the two configuration directives specified earlier,
thus we're simply appending them to the end of the configuration file:</p>

<pre>
root@solaris:~# <kbd>bash -c 'echo LockFile /var/apache2/2.2/logs/accept.lock &gt;&gt; /etc/apache2/2.2/httpd.conf'</kbd>
root@solaris:~# <kbd>bash -c 'echo PidFile /var/apache2/2.2/run/httpd.pid &gt;&gt; /etc/apache2/2.2/httpd.conf'</kbd> 
</pre> 

<p>OK, everything is in place. Let´s give it a try.</p>



<pre>
root@solaris:~# <kbd>svcadm disable apache22</kbd> 
svc:/network/http:apache22 disabled. 
root@solaris:~# <kbd>svcadm -v enable -s apache22</kbd> 
svc:/network/http:apache22 enabled. 
</pre> 

<p>Now we check for the running httpd processes:</p>

<pre>
root@solaris:~# <kbd>ps -ef | grep httpd | grep -v grep</kbd>
webservd  2032  2031   0 14:34:27 ?           0:00 /usr/apache2/2.2/bin/httpd -k start
webservd  2031     1   1 14:34:26 ?           0:00 /usr/apache2/2.2/bin/httpd -k start
webservd  2033  2031   0 14:34:27 ?           0:00 /usr/apache2/2.2/bin/httpd -k start
webservd  2034  2031   0 14:34:27 ?           0:00 /usr/apache2/2.2/bin/httpd -k start
webservd  2036  2031   0 14:34:27 ?           0:00 /usr/apache2/2.2/bin/httpd -k start
webservd  2035  2031   0 14:34:27 ?           0:00 /usr/apache2/2.2/bin/httpd -k start
</pre>

<p>You notice the difference ? There is no httpd running as root. All processes
run with the userid webservd. Mission accomplished.</p>

<p>Let's check the privileges of the processes. At first the one, who ran as
<code>root</code> before:</p>

<pre>root@solaris:~# ppriv 2031
2031:	/usr/apache2/2.2/bin/httpd -k start
flags = &lt;none&gt;
	E: basic,!file_link_any,net_privaddr,!proc_info,!proc_session
	I: basic,!file_link_any,net_privaddr,!proc_info,!proc_session
	P: basic,!file_link_any,net_privaddr,!proc_info,!proc_session
	L: all
</pre>


<p>Only the least privileges to do the job, no root privileges. And even the
other processes are more secure now. Before we changed the configuration of the
webserver, it had the basic privileges of a regular user. Now we have limited even
this set.</p>

<p>But we still need to be a privileged user to start apache. Wouldn't it be
nice if I could delegate management of "services" to unprivileged users. I can
use authorizations to do that, and authorizations is integrated with SMF. There
are two authorizations we will need to add to our user to give hi the right to
manage the apach22 service. We need an authorization to manage our service as
well as a authorization to change the state of our service:</p>

<ul>

	<li><code>solaris.smf.value.http/apache22</code> &#45; Gives a user the right to
	modify the value of a property in the Apache service.</li>
	<li><code>solaris.smf.manage.http/apache22</code> &#45; Gives a user the right to
	change the state of a the Apache service with <code>svcadm</code>.</li> </ul>

 <p>Both are needed to change the state of a service, as the state of the
 service is kept as a property for the service.</p>

<pre>
root@solaris:~# <kbd>svcprop http:apache22 | grep auth</kbd> 
httpd/value_authorization astring solaris.smf.value.http/apache22 
general/action_authorization astring solaris.smf.manage.http/apache22 
general/value_authorization astring solaris.smf.value.http/apache22 
</pre> 

<p>First we need to add our authorizations to <code>/etc/security/auth_attr</code></p> 

<pre>
root@solaris:~# <kbd>echo solaris.smf.manage.http:::Mange Apache 2.2:: &gt;&gt; /etc/security/auth_attr </kbd>
root@solaris:~# <kbd>echo solaris.smf.value.http:::Mange Apache 2.2:: &gt;&gt; /etc/security/auth_attr</kbd>
</pre>

<p><b>Note: </b>In most SMF manifests one authorization is used for both action_authorization and
value_authorization, as they are commonly used together.</p>

<p>Now lets add those authorizations to our old friend <code>jdoe</code>.</p>

<pre>
root@solaris:~# <kbd>usermod -A solaris.smf.manage.http/apache22,solaris.smf.value.http/apache22 jdoe</kbd>
Found user in files repository.
root@solaris:~# <kbd>userattr auths jdoe</kbd>
solaris.smf.manage.http/apache22,solaris.smf.value.http/apache22
</pre>

<p>Lets see if <code>jdoe</code> can start and stop apache now</p>

<pre>
root@solaris:~# <kbd>su - jdoe</kbd>
Oracle Corporation	SunOS 5.11	11.0	 November 2011
jdoe@solaris:~$ <kbd>svcadm disable apache22</kbd>
jdoe@solaris:~$ <kbd>svcs *apache*</kbd>
STATE          STIME    FMRI
disabled       14:57:51 svc:/network/http:apache22
jdoe@solaris:~$ <kbd>svcadm enable apache22</kbd>
jdoe@solaris:~$ <kbd>svcs *apache*</kbd>
STATE          STIME    FMRI
online         14:58:24 svc:/network/http:apache22
</pre>



<p>That worked fine, so by using SMF we've been able to take a service such
as apache, remove its need to start as root by giving it the privileges it
needed and nothing more. We also removed some privileges that apache doesn't
need, but a hacker might use them to take control of your system.</p>

<p>Add to that we added the right to manage the apache service via SMF to an
unprivileged user by giving him the correct authorizations that allows a user to
manage that particular service and nothing else, as you can see here.</p>

<pre>
jdoe@solaris:~$ <kbd>svcs sendmail</kbd> 
STATE          STIME    FMRI 
online          6:48:12 svc:/network/smtp:sendmail 
jdoe@solaris:~$ <kbd>svcadm disable sendmail </kbd>
svcadm: svc:/network/smtp:sendmail: Permission denied.
